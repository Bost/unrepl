# How to upgrade a repl to unrepl 

(Audience: repl client authors)

Once you have a connection to a REPL, you send the content of the resource file `unrepl/blob.clj` to it (the file is not present in the repository but should be present in the artifact, it's generated by `lein unrepl-make-blob`).

Either you get `[:unrepl.upgrade/failed]` or `[:unrepl/hello ...]` on the repl output. Upon failure you are back in the repl you started from.

Each use of the blob creates gensymed namespaces.

You can customize the blob: enter `lein unrepl-make-blob target-file '{...here goes custom session actions..}'`. Actions who have a qualified symbol as first in topmost function position will automatically require this namespace on first use.
